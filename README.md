# ExpandedThirdPartyAPI

Created for the D&D character creator, this API will also include expansions of the 5E Core Guide Book. The API will include several new classes, items, spells, races, and much more to accomodate for the lack of variety in the core 5E API being used for the DnD Character Creator.
